Hi! :)

I'm Sai Charan. I hail from Bangalore, India. I am now living in Stuttgart, Germany. I am a developer who likes to solve complex real-world problems through software. I did my bachelors in Information Science and Engineering and graduated in the year 2015. Currently, pursuing a Master's degree focusing on distributed systems at the University of Bamberg, Germany. I am passionate about web technologies and a wannabe polyglot. My interests lie in cloud computing technologies, Kubernetes in specific. Javascript, Clojure, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, React.js, and Java are the technologies I've worked and comfortable with. After watching Rob Pike's talks, I am now more keen on doing golang. An ardent liverpool fan, likes reading Calvin and Hobbes comics, playing board games and watch some interesting content on Netflix. I love to play table tennis and badminton. I closely follow cricket and football.

While I was in college although I got placed in two of the well reputed service-based companies, I was keen on building products. I wanted to learn by building. So I self-learned HTML, CSS and some JavaScript since I didn't know where to start from. And then, I got into the only coding boot camp in the Bangalore city, Geekskool. Geekskool stressed on building software without using any frameworks. Apart from this, Geekskool also introduced me to a lot of Unix concepts, Git and the Functional Programming paradigm. As a project in Geekskool, I was involved in building the UI for the blog of Geekskool. Next, I sought to find a company where I could build usable software that impacts society. Quintype was such a place.

Quintype is a data-driven publishing platform for digital media organizations and content creators which is being consumed by thousands of users. During my first year at Quintype, my primary role was to work on front-end web applications. I single-handedly worked on building and architecting features for the core platform front-end. To build the features on the front-end I used React.js and Redux extensively. After a year of building front-end applications, I became more inquisitive towards the backend. I was curious to know what was happening behind the scenes, to know how an entire application works end to end as a system as a whole, most importantly how a single request travels all the way from the browser till the company’s virtual private cloud and serves the user’s request. This motivated to learn more about the backend. During my second year in Quintype as a backend engineer, I worked for the same core platform team. My primary responsibilities included building API’s, optimize code performance and to work on various server-side aspects of the core platform. With a good competency in Web development, I grasped most of the things that are happening behind the scenes and learned Clojure programming language. Apart from building API’s or features, I also comprehended about caching and how to tool it across various layers of the application. I was also introduced to the writing unit, integration, and end to end tests and was stimulated to follow Test Driven Development(TDD). Learning TDD helped me write top quality software code ensuring as fewer bugs as possible. During this time, I also worked on creating and building docker images and working with Kubernetes on the infra side.
